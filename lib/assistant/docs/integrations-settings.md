Configure the system email (for transactional emails like password resets, invoice sends):

Some settings require environment variables (set in `.env`):
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` — session security key

These are managed by the developer/system admin and are not accessible via the UI.

- **Custom webhooks**: Send to `/api/webhooks` with `BOT_API_TOKEN` header

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| API key not working | Check the key is ACTIVE and has the correct scope. Re-generate if needed. |
| Gmail sync stopped | OAuth token likely expired → go to `/manager/email/mailboxes` → reconnect Gmail |
| Leexi imports not appearing | Check LEEXI_API_KEY_ID and LEEXI_API_KEY_SECRET in system config → test connection |
| Enrichment returning no results | Check APOLLO_API_KEY / SERP_API_KEY are valid → quota may be exhausted |
| Google Drive sync failing | Reconnect OAuth → check folder permissions in Google Drive |
| SMTP email failing | Go to `/manager/settings` → test connection → check credentials and port |
